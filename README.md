I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from UFC (Federal University of Ceara) since 2010 and from 2021 onwards I started my career migration to Data Science.

I have mastery of all stages of developing a business solution using the concepts and tools of Data Science, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I have already developed solutions for important business problems such as detecting fraud in transactions, classifying diseases early, identifying customers in churn and prioritizing customers for cross-selling.

The details of each solution are described in the projects below.


**Analytical Tools:**
